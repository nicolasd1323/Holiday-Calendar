## Project Description

The idea of this project is to have a functional and dynamic holiday calendar of the United States using JavaScript, HTML and CSS flex box model. Also, I will add an external API to the project.

## API and Data Sample

```"holidays":
{
"name": "New Year's Day",
"description": "New Year's Day is the first day of the Gregorian calendar, which is widely used in many countries such as the USA.",
"id": "us",
"name": "United States"
},
"date": {
"iso": "2019-01-01",
"datetime": {
"year": 2019,

```
